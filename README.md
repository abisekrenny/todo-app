# ToDo Application

Welcome to the Todo Application! This project is a replica of a to-do list app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application is created from scratch, focusing on key DOM manipulation and JavaScript concepts. Let’s break down the features and components of this app:

## Features
- Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- Existing tasks can be edited or marked as complete.
- Tasks can also be deleted if no longer needed.

## Components
### User Interface
- The user interface is designed using HTML and styled with CSS.
- The application uses CSS animations to enhance the user experience.

## Storage
- The app utilizes the browser’s localStorage to store information about the to-do tasks entered by the user.
- Data persists even when the browser is closed or refreshed, making it convenient for future sessions.

## Future Plans
- I plan to incoporate deadline date for each todo task.
- I also plan to incoporate user management and storage.
